# PredictionChallenges

These are my prediction models for Prediction Challenges in Data Literacy course.

## Challenge 1

Given: student's major, seniority, and score

Prediction: student's grade

In this challenge, we could not use machine learning models for our predictions. After analyzing the data by categorizing each entry, I created cutoffs for each category. I had to extend ranges where there was not enough data in order to cover all possible values.

I placed 1st out of 218 students in our class for this challenge with an accuracy of 92.3%

## Challenge 2

Given: student's major, seniority, and score

Prediction: student's grade

In this challenge, we could use machine learning models for our predictions. I used multiple decision trees on the categories I previously made to predict the grades.

I placed 1st out of 212 students in our class for this challenge with an accuracy of 92.3%

## Challenge 3

Given: student's GPA, number of professional connections, major, graduation year, number of credits, number of parking tickets

Prediction: student's earnings after graduation

I used linear regression after partitioning the data into categories. I found that some variables affected the student's earnings in certain cases and other variables determined the earnings in other cases. Some variables did not have any effect on the earnings at all.

I placed 2nd out of 192 students in our class for this challenge with a mean square error of 90.850861.
